            <p class="text">While with the Eleven Fifty Accademy, I had the opportunity to work on numerous projects both individually and collaboratively.  My newest creation is a play on a popular dating app, which I call TinderForPets.  Contrary to what the name might suggest, this is a fun website made with the goal of connecting animal shelter pets with new, loving homes.</p>

        <p class="text">Through my times learning about economics and business at Hanover College, I had the privilege of working in the banking world as well being introduced to computer science. This facilitated a smoothe transistion into a financially centered roll at Thrivent, a faith based financial services institution. Upon collaboration with a number of clients and associates working and enjoying rewarding careers in software engineering, I made the choice to pursue this avenue at the Eleven Fifty Academy, and found my true passion.</p>

                    <p>Mark Suverkrup brings amazing energy to any team. As a student, he worked hard and completed all his work in a timely manner. Communication is definitely one of his strong suits. He is a natural leader who is sure to be an asset in any group.</p><br>

                    <p>A positive attitude can get you a long way, and that is one of Mark's strongest traits. I had the pleasure of having Mark as a student in the Software Development track of Eleven Fifty Academy, and throughout our short time together I was able to not only see him expand his coding knowledge but also able to see how he adapted to challenges along the way. Coming into the program Mark had some fundamental skills in coding from prior python experience, so throughout the process of transitioning into C# and .Net he quickly began pushing the bar higher on goals for his projects. This led to many interesting journeys and some interesting struggles along the way. During any of these struggles, Mark maintained his positive outlook and even if he didn’t fully grasp something at first, he took any bit of forward momentum and ran with it, enabling him to push further and conquer any potential roadblocks. Additionally, he carried this positive outlook through both solo and group projects and was frequently encouraging others to do their best and push their potential as well. Mark will make an invaluable addition to any team environment. Not only is he already proficient coder but his drive towards success can only be further bolstered by his unwavering positivity.</p><br>
